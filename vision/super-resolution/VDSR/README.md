# VDSR

## Description

VDSR was proposed by Jiwon Kim et al. in 2016. The author mainly uses a deep convolutional network based on VGG-Net, which only learns residuals and use extremely high learning rates (104 times higher than SRCNN) enabled by adjustable gradient clipping, and ultimately has a great advantage in image quality performance.
